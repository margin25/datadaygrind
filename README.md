# Inspiration
There are many mood tracking apps that keep a log of a user's mood for a specific day, and to look back at the end of the month to see the mood progress of the user. We, the iRemember team, however wanted to create an app that somehow captures important moments of an user's day, and turn it into a visualization users can look back at to see their wellness trends, and how these small moments (such as the hrs of sleep, daily tasks, feelings, thoughts, and moods) have progressed for any particular time period. Our motto is: To make a difference in the world, we need to make a positive impact in peoples lives.

# What it does
We wanted to create a daily task tracker, where a mobile app would help a user track simple things he/she does daily, and then help him/her see the pattern. For example, on a scale of 1-10, how healthy were your meals today, how easy was it to fall asleep, how much did you spent on social media, how much time you spent around nature, how much physical movement you did, how stressed were you or how optimistic are you. We would split these questions into different tracks -> 'Mood', 'Sleep', 'Health and Wellness', and 'Daily Tasks you did today'. Then we could show the users the correlation through graphs. For instance, a user can see whenever they got more hours of sleep, they felt less stressed and more peaceful (through the mood tracker and sleep tracker). Whenever you exercised, it was easier to fall asleep. Whenever you spent more time on social media, you felt your life was purposeless.

# How we built it
We built the three pages (home, tracking page, and trends) using react native and javascript.

# Challenges we ran into
Ran into some debugging issues with react native, since it was a new tool for us! But we learned a lot from it!

# Accomplishments that we are proud of
Built a UI interface and home page + tracking with react native and got to learn several different and cool functionalities of app development!

# What's next for iREMEMBER
Building more pages and integrating the app together to launch it to the world. We also want our product to potentially help and support Alzheimers patients in the future as well. To make a difference in the world, we need to make a positive impact in peoples lives.
